# Strings
This project is about manipulating strings in Python. We will be creating variables for each player that scored and each minute of the match that a goal was scored in. We will then be using the +-operator to create a string which reports on who scored when. We will also use f-strings and the +-operator to create a single string with information about who scored when in the specified format. We will also be using slicing, find-method and len to isolate and store the length of their last name, and the player's name in the specified format. Finally, we will be creating a chant name with no end-space.
